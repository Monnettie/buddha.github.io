        With any organization that promotes happiness and well-being, adaptation is imperative. 
        Over the years the modern world’s idea of success and fulfillment has warped itself beyond the practices of the old religion. 
        This perial is especially prevalent in Buddhism, as self-fulfillment and happiness are the key points of its teachings. 
        To adapt to this new age, Buddhism has adopted new practices to appeal to the modern generation.

        <p>
            In a world of science and understanding, a change of focus was necessary. 
            As more understanding of our world became accessible, many questioned the idea of gods, spirits, and enlightenment. 
            To adapt to this, less emphasis was put on the supernatural and unrealistic, and more on the teachings that could be combined with modern science. 
            As this proved to be successful, Buddhists decided to apply the idea to one of the many staples of Buddhism, meditation.

            <em>"Buddhist leaders put forward a highly rationalized interpretation of Buddhism that de-emphasized the supernormal 
            and ritualized aspects of the tradition and focused on the supposed continuity between Buddhism and modern science 
            and on the centrality of ethics and morality." - Giuseppe Tucci  "Buddhism in the Contemporary World"</em>

            Westerners were often interested more in the physiological benefits of meditation, rather than the teachings that accompany them. 
            This led to Buddhists developing a modern form of meditation that could be inserted into health programs, anger management, and other therapeutic settings. 
            This also meant that mediation became more disconnected from Buddhism, and more associated with modern psychology.
        </p>
        <p>
            While this disconnection lost some of meditation’s original Buddhist teachings, the change allowed Buddhism to become much more legitimate in the eyes of science. 
            It stressed the prevalent links between psychology and Buddhism, allowing it to become more prevalent and normalized. 
            This went on to become a dialogue between psychologists and Buddhist teachers,  and how they could use psychology to help improve the mental state of others. 
            Today these practices are used for medical care and promoted wellness centers everywhere.

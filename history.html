        The First American Buddhists
    </h2>
    <p>
        To fully understand the transition of Buddhism from a religion to a wellness fad, 
        we must look back on the events that brought it to this point in the first place.
        Buddhism first arrived in the middle of the 19th century in Hawaii, when Chinese people immigrated for work.
        They were soon followed by Japanese immigrants in the late 19th century. Both groups started to build their respective
        monasteries and temples, marking the full bringing of Buddhism to the West. However, most Americans didn't understand or disagreed
        Buddhism, and rejected anything having to do with it. This led to heavy discrimination toward Asians and Buddhists.

            Rejection to Tolerance
        </h3>
        <p>
            Both Buddhists and Asians, in general, faced hostile, and sometimes violent, discrimination and racism.
            They were labeled as "silent invaders" accused of stealing jobs from the American people. 
            There were many riots and protests, the most famous being the San Fransisco Anti-Chinese riot in 1866.
            This riot lead to the banning of firecrackers and ceremonial gongs, which were often used in Buddhist ceremonies and traditions.
            This all culminated in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which prevented Chinese people from immigrating to America for ten years.

            "I know that some will have hard thoughts of me, when they hear their Christ named beside my Buddha, yet I am sure that I am willing they should love their Christ more than my Buddha, for the love is the main thingâ€¦" - Henry David Thoreau 
            </em>

        <p> 
            While this was happening, Buddhists began to converse with scholars about their teachings. 
            One of these scholars, Henry David Thoreau, went as far as to translate the Lotus Sutra and write about it in his essays.
            He was the first big name to take an interest in Buddhism and even adopt it alongside Christianity.
            From there, more scriptures began to reach America and increase the popularity of Buddhism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Americans started to see Buddhism as this "exotic" aesthetic. 
            Bostonians William Sturgis Bigelow and Ernest Fenollosa were two of the most avid Japanese 
            and Buddhist art collectors, and spent several years in Japan.
            They soon became infatuated with Buddhist teachings and adopted the religion themselves.
            While this aesthetic attraction would help Buddhists survive for the next few years, 
            it would prove to have a devastating effect on the culture and tradition behind the teachings and practices.

        Old Culture, New Wave
    </h2>
    <p>
        America is the melting pot of the world.
        Here we are lucky enough to experience cultures and traditions from miles and miles away.
        With these cultures come new religions and ways of thinking.
        While we can learn from these new ideas, America tends to throw them to the wayside, in favor of easy access and marketing.
        Religions from hundreds or thousands of years ago turn into nothing more but a trendy fad.

    <h2>
        The Loss of Meaning
    </h2>
    <p>
        In this new age of society, popularity is most important, especially in the survival of traditions.
        Often to meet the standards and expectations of Americans, cultures, and religions will simplify their practices for the sake of their survival.
        While this does increase longevity, it ends up doing more harm than good.
        By forcing religions to simplify themselves, we lose a lot of the original meaning behind the teachings.
        To the point where spirituality turns into wellness.
        This webpage is dedicated to this phenomenon surrounding Buddhism, but it is far from the only victim of this.
        I urge you to go and seek out other religions and cultures that have been lost to trends and popular media.
        What you consider a simple exercise has a meaning that shouldn't be lost in time.
